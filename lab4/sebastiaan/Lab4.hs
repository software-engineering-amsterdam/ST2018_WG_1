 Exercise1:

 Question1:
 In chapter 4 they talk about sets and how they specify a set.
 In this particular example they gave the example of a specification as follows:

            {n^2| n ∈ {0, . . . , 999}}

 Now my question is does this specify a finite set from {0^2, ..., 999^2}?
 Or is it just to check wheter a number n is within a set {0, ..., 999}?


 Question2:
 Why is a set with a single element not the same as a that single element?


 Question3:
 Why is a set {a,b,b} the same as {a,b}?

 Exercise4:

 Question1:
 The following definition was given for the domain of R:
 "The set dom (R) = {x | ∃y ( xRy )}, i.e., the set consisting of all first coordinates
 of pairs in R, is called the domain of R"

 Now they gave the example R = {(1, 4),(1, 5),(2, 5)} which, according to the book, has
 the domain "dom (R) = {1, 2}" but why is it not "dom (R) = {1, 1, 2}"?
 
 This might be resulting in the same answer as Question3 from Exercise1    

 Question2:
 So the integer partitions of 4 where 4 ∈ N+ are:

    A = [4], [1, 3], [2, 2], [1, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1, 1].

 Now they say that |A| == n in this case 4 but this results in 5? So do they skip one partition or something?

 Exercise7:
    The exercises can be test through running exercise7.
    This results in a quickcheck for test5 and test6.
    In test5 we compare if the symClos of xs is the same as the reverse of symClos of xs
    In test6 we test if the trClos is the same as the trClos of the trClos of xs.
