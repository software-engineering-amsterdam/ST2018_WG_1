-- Exercise 1 (1 hour)
-- To test are definitions we used two forms per definiotion.
-- The first test per definition should be true and the second
-- should be false. Thus test1a, test1c, test1e and test1g should
-- be true and test1b, test1d, test1f and test1h should be fasle.

-- Exercise 2

-- Exercise 3 (1.5 hour)
-- When translating a form to CNF we need to make the form arrowfree,
-- then make it to negation normal form and then distribute
-- disjuntions inward according to:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form
-- The arrowfree and nnf are given so we only need to implement
-- the function cnf which distribute the disjunctions inwards.
toCNF :: Form -> Form
toCNF f = cnf (nnf (arrowfree f))

-- This function distribute the disjunctions inwards by looking at
-- every disjunction and replace "P or (Q and R)" with
-- "(P or Q) and (P or R)"
