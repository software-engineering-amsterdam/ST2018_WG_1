-- Exercise 5 (NON)
-- This is the same answer as to question 4 because of the constraints we added
-- in the previous exercises it is allready NRC form.

-- You can generate a sudoku with 3 and 4 empty blocks, 5 and up is not possible.
-- But only when the empty grids are not in the same row or collum grids.
-- Because when we have two empty grids in one direction, we can change
-- the row or collum of a number between the two grids.
-- Due to the extra constraints implemented in ex1 and ex2, this code generates a
-- NRC sudoku.
-- Works, but is very slow.
-- To run do ex4_21 3 or a amount of blocks you want to delete.
